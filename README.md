# Digital_Marketing_Analysis
This Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into the costs and revenue of FreshCart, an e-commerce platform for over a specified time across significant states in the US using various social media platforms.

### Objective
This project analyzes FreshCart's past advertising data and creates a strategy to optimize its digital ad spending. The specific objectives are:
  A. Evaluate the effectiveness of current advertising campaigns across platforms.
  B. Identify top-performing channels for advertising.
  C. Assess demography engagement and conversion rates.
  D. Recommend strategies for better budget allocation.

### Problem statement
FreshCart, like many e-commerce platforms, relies heavily on online advertising to acquire new customers and retain existing ones. However, amid an increasingly competitive market and fluctuating ad costs, the company has identified two main challenges:
A. Inefficient Ad Spend: The company suspects that not every dollar spent on digital advertising is yielding the desired ROI. Some campaigns may be costing more than they return in revenue.
B. Identifying Effective Channels: With multiple platforms available for advertising, from search engines to social media, FreshCart is finding it challenging to determine which channels offer the best return on investment.
As the competition in the online grocery sector has skyrocketed, the cost of customer acquisition is rising. FreshCart is looking for the most efficient way to save costs and optimize its digital ad spend.
### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is "Digital_Marketing_Analysis.xlsx", which contains the following information:
•	Platform
•	adStartDate
•	adDurationDate
•	Costs
•	Impression
•	Clicks
•	Conversions
•	ConversionValue
•	State
•	CPC

### Methodology
For one to analyze the marketing ad data, we already had cleaned data. We went ahead to performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
Here, some major cost metrics were extracted using:
•	Total Costs per Platform: Studying the costs put in for each platform
•	Total Revenue per Platform: Analysing which platform had the most revenue
•	Comparison-Sales by Store: Understanding which states had the highest cost and revenue respectively

### Key Insights
From the analysis, we observed the following:
### Sum of Conversion Value
YouTube generated the highest Conversion Value(Profit) to the sum of about 30 million
### Sum of Costs per Platform
Facebook ads cost the most with a total of almost 10,000
### Comparison across States
The cost to run ads in some states was higher than the matching revenue for eg, it costs about 2,000 to run ads in Illinois which generated a profit of a little over 1,500 total.
### General Ad Performance
In total, it cost almost 30,000 to run ads across  all 10 states with a total revenue of about 98, 000 with Georgia having the highest revenue of almost 20,000 with an ad cost of 3,248. 
Also, a Facebook ad cost almost 10,000 only gave a profit of about 22,000 whereas, a YouTube ad which cost about 2,500 yielded a profit of almost 30,000 in total.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
Based on the findings from this analysis, the following were recommended:
1.	More ads should be run on the platform that has more revenue.
2.	The state of Georgia should be pumped with more ads since it has the highest revenue across states. 
3.	More studies should be done in areas with low revenue. It is possible that the age demographic in Georgia differs from the other states, therefore, the ads run there should be tailored to the people who reside in these areas for maximum profit.
4.	Incentives and discounts should also be advertised in these states with low revenue.
5.	Other social media platforms with low to average revenue should have ad boost in the form of discounts, freebies, and more ads targeting the dominant audience in them. This will also boost revenue.
6.	Seek customer feedback in both the platforms and states with low revenue to improve her ads sales further.
